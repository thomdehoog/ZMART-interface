"""Declaring one OME-Zarr image, ready to be filled with one position's pixels.

Brought from ZMART-microscopy's ``zmart_storage`` writer (``canvas.py`` and
``positions.py``), with only what the interface calls: :class:`Channel`,
:func:`declare_image` and :func:`how_many_copies_a_position_can_keep`.

What an image declared here looks like
--------------------------------------

Five axes, always in this order: time, channel, depth, and the two directions
across the specimen (``t, c, z, y, x``). A full-size level and a few smaller
copies of it, each half as wide and half as tall as the one before, made by
keeping every second voxel rather than averaging, and each saying how large its
voxels are and where the image's corner sits on the stage. Every piece of the
image is one plane of one channel at one moment, so showing a plane never means
fetching its neighbours. Nothing is written into the image here: declaring it
costs a few hundred bytes of description and no picture at all.

        The ``min`` and ``max`` written here are the range of numbers the camera
        can produce at all — nought to 65535 for a 16-bit camera — which is a
        plain fact about the data and always worth recording.

        The ``start`` and ``end`` are a different thing: they are the brightness
        range the image should first be *displayed* with.

        These used to be left out when a run did not ask for a window, on the
        reasoning that a viewer would then measure a good one from the pixels.
        That reasoning was sound but the file it produced was not: **a describing
        block with an incomplete window is refused outright.** Checked against
        ngio, a block naming a channel without ``start`` and ``end`` fails to
        open, while the same image with no describing block at all opens
        perfectly well. So the choice was never "a measured window or a declared
        one" — it was "a complete window or no channel names and colours at all",
        and names and colours are worth having.

        So a window is always written now. When the run did not ask for one, the
        camera's whole range is declared, because that is the honest thing to say
        when nothing is known. Be aware of what that looks like: a real
        acquisition sits in the bottom few per cent of a camera's range — a few
        hundred counts of background with the signal not far above — so an image
        opened on the whole range looks almost black until somebody drags the
        contrast slider. **A run that knows roughly how bright its images are
        should pass a window**, and its acquisitions will open looking like
        something.

    """How many zoomed-out copies one position can usefully keep, counting itself.

    This is the number that decides whether the picture the viewer opens has to
    write anything at all, so it is worth understanding rather than tuning.

    A view points at a position's own zoomed-out copies instead of computing its
    own, which it may do because shrinking here keeps every second voxel rather
    than averaging four — so a voxel of a position's smaller copy is a voxel of the
    whole picture's smaller copy, and belongs to that one position and no other.

    Halving stops when a copy would be smaller than one piece, because a piece is
    the smallest thing that can be handed to the browser. A position 2048 voxels
    across kept in pieces of 128 therefore carries five copies — 2048, 1024, 512,
    256, 128 — and a view over such positions writes nothing at all at those five
    zooms. **Anything coarser than the last of them is a different matter**: it has
    no copy to point at, so it is written from the positions' pixels. Which zooms a
    picture has is decided by how wide the run is, not by the position, so a wide
    enough run always writes its coarse end however many copies a position keeps.
    That is the only thing a run writes twice, it is small, and the note at the top
    of this module gives the measurement.

    **The catch, and it is the reason a run can end up writing copies anyway.** A
    position has to begin on a multiple of the piece size times the largest shrink,
    or its copy would keep a different set of voxels from the ones the picture
    would have kept — a different picture, not a rounding difference. A position
    the same size as a piece can only ever carry one copy, whatever is asked for.

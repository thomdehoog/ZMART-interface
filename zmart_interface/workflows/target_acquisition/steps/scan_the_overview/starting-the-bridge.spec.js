/**
 * The bridge these walks start runs the interface the environment holds, not
 * the folder the walk happens to be started in.
 *
 * Python puts the folder it is started in at the front of its search path.
 * The walks start the bridge from the root of this repository, where a folder
 * called `zmart_interface` sits, so without care the walk tests that folder
 * instead of the package an operator installs -- and stays green while the
 * shipped package is broken. A developer with an editable install still gets
 * their working copy, because the installation itself points there.
 *
 * No page is opened: this asks only where Python finds the interface.

/**
 * Alignment points that disagree are said to disagree.
 *
 * From the review of 10 October, finding 7: the carrier is placed by the
 * average shift of the points snapped to the stage, and a turn of the
 * carrier is never corrected. Points snapped at the wrong well, or a carrier
 * sitting turned in its holder, made the points disagree by millimetres,
 * and they were averaged without a word. Correcting a turn is a decision
 * still to be made; saying that the points disagree is not.

"""Target acquisition's ledgers: what each of its runs has done so far.

One dictionary per run, updated in place and read through this module
(``ledgers.scan``, never a copied name), so a value one module sets is the
value the next one sees and the page that polls reads. ``focus`` is the
focus map, ``scan`` the overview scan, ``targets`` discovery, ``acquired``
the target run and ``plots`` the population plots.

What every run *captured* is the bridge's general record
(``state.records``, by kind of acquisition); these are only how far each
run has got.

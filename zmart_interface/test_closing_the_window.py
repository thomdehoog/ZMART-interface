"""Closing the window closes the session, the picture server and the bridge.

From the review of 10 October, finding 15: when ``webview.start()`` returned,
the launcher returned too, and the session with the microscope software was
never closed; a driver that holds a client connection to the vendor
software left it hanging until the process was killed. Now the window's
end, however it comes, stops a running scan between two fields, closes the
session (which stops the picture server and the analysis workers), and
shuts the bridge down.

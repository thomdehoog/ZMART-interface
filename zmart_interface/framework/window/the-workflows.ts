/**
 * The workflows this page offers: every folder in `workflows/` with a
 * `flow.js` or `flow.ts` inside it, found by the build tool's folder scan and assembled by
 * the framework. The unit tests read the same folders, so a workflow the tests
 * can see is a workflow the operator can choose. The list used to be written
 * out by hand — twice, at one point — and the copies drifted apart in silence,
 * which is why it is now read off the disk instead.
 *
 * A module of its own because the build puts the folder scan's imports at the
 * top of the module that holds it: here, they come after `main.ts` has
 * imported the frame's stylesheet, so each workflow's stylesheet follows it.

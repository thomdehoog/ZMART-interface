/**
 * The operator page, put together.
 *
 * This file starts the page and nothing else: it reads which workflow to
 * open on, hands the workflows the build found to the composition
 * (`pages.js`), which builds the frame and each workflow's page over it, and
 * opens the page. Nothing here names a workflow, a backend or a panel: the
 * page would compose the same way for a workflow about e-learning or about
 * image analysis.
 *
 * What a workflow's page carries -- the run document, its steps and panels,
 * its backend, the boxes its steps show, what it lends and its hooks -- is
 * written out in `pages.js`, and what a workflow may rely on of it in
 * `workflows/README.md`.

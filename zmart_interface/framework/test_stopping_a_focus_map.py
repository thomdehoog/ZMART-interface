"""The operator's Interrupt reaches a focus point whose scoring has hung.

From the review of 10 October, finding 16: the page's Interrupt only set a
flag that the page reads between two points. A point whose scoring never
answered (an analysis worker that stopped responding) kept the request open
for ever, the focus map stayed "running", and every scan and new map was
refused until the operator reconnected. Stopping discovery already puts the
analysis workers down; stopping a focus map now does the same.

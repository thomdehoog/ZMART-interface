/* The page's own code reads no test hook.
 *
 * A `window.__name` is a hook: the module that owns a thing leaves it there
 * for the browser tests to look in. It is not a way for one part of the page
 * to reach another -- that is a side door, and a tie nothing else can see:
 * no import says it is there, so moving or renaming the owner breaks the
 * reader without a word from the type checker or the import rules.
 * `docs/principles.md` says so; this test holds it.
 *
 * It reads every page file under `zmart_interface/` (not the tests, which are
 * what the hooks are for, and not the build), finds which module sets each
 * hook, and refuses any other module that names it. Comments are left out:
 * a comment may say where a test looks. */

"""The operator page's bridge, held to the driver contract it speaks to.

Every fault these cover was invisible from the page: the window drew a focus
map, the rows filled with numbers, and every number was a zero. What the page
cannot see is which key a driver puts its answer under, so that is what is
asserted here — against stubs shaped like the ZMART drivers, answering every
command in the controller's two-part ``{"success", "content"}`` shape, and
against the mock microscope plugged in through the controller.

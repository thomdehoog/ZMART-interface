"""The copies drawn with the canvas's display settings are kept up to a limit.

From the review of 10 October, finding 20: every brightness setting the
operator tried on every field was kept as its own picture, up to about a
megapixel each, until the scan was started again. Dragging the contrast
across a large overview made the bridge grow without bound. The copies are
now kept up to a limit, and the one used longest ago goes first.

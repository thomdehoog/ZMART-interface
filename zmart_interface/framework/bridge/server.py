"""The HTTP shell: routes in, JSON out, errors as sentences.

Every route is one of the page's backend verbs, dispatched to the workflow's
Python half that does the work. The server also hands out the built page, so
the microscope computer runs one program on one address. It knows no
workflow and no instrument: each workflow's half registers its own routes.

Standard library only, on purpose. The microscope computer has no network
to install packages from, and this server is a handful of routes: a
framework would save thirty lines and cost a dependency forever.

The routes are a table, ``ROUTES``, from ``(method, path)`` to the function
that answers it. A workflow's Python half puts its routes there through
:func:`add_route`, under ``/api/<its folder>/``. A handler takes
``(asked, query)`` -- the request's JSON body as a dictionary (empty for a
GET) and the raw query string -- and answers the dictionary the page
receives, or bytes (:class:`api.Bytes`); an exception it raises becomes the
sentence the page shows, with the status :meth:`Bridge._fail` gives it.

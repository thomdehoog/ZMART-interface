"""The protocols: the settings a run ran with, written beside it, and the ones saved by name.

A finished run leaves ``protocol.json`` beside its pictures; the next
session lists every one under the machine's output root and can open on
it. Protocols saved on purpose live in the computer's ZMART folder, so they

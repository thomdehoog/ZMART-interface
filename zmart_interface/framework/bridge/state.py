"""What the bridge keeps between two requests: the open session, the run folder, and what was captured.

One module owns every fact the bridge's general part keeps between two
requests, so that the other modules read and write the same thing and none
of them has to know which thread last touched it. Each is a plain module
attribute and is read through this module (``state.session``, never a
copied name), so a value one module sets is the value the next one sees.

``records`` keeps every capture by the workflow's own name for its
acquisition (overview, focussing, targets, ...), which no driver reports:
the bridge stamps it on each record from what it asked for. How far a
workflow's own runs have got is that workflow's, in its Python half.

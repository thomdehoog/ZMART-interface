"""The bridge: where the operator page's backend verbs meet each workflow's Python half.

The operator page runs in a browser and cannot import Python, so it speaks
to this package over HTTP. The bridge serves the built page, and dispatches
every ``/api/`` route to the workflow's Python half that registered it,
under ``/api/<folder>/``. It knows no workflow and no instrument: a half
(``zmart_interface/workflows/<folder>/bridge``) brings its own routes, its
own command-line options, what it does at start and what it closes at the
end, and imports of the framework only ``api.py``, the agreement between
the two.

* ``api`` — what a half is handed and may answer: bytes, and a refusal with
  a status of its own.
* ``workflows`` — every workflow's Python half, found and wired in at
  start-up.
* ``server`` — the routes as a table, the built page, who may ask, and
  ``serve``/``main``.

Run on its own, for a browser instead of the window::

    python -m zmart_interface.framework.bridge --port 8600

It starts every workflow's Python half with it: target acquisition offers
its own mock microscope first, and the LAS X simulator's stand-in pixels when
asked (``zmart_interface/workflows/target_acquisition/bridge/starting.py``).

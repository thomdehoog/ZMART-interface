/**
 * Three steps -- a workflow that knows nothing about a microscope.
 *
 * This is the framework's own acceptance fixture: the smallest workflow that
 * uses every field and every hook the workflow API offers, with no Python
 * behind it besides one route and no canvas. It imports nothing but the
 * API. It stands under `framework/fixtures/` rather than under `workflows/`,
 * so the operator's chooser never offers it; the unit tests assemble it the
 * way the page assembles the real workflows. It is also where to start a
 * new workflow from.
 *
 * What it does is deliberately dull. Begin is settled by standing on it;
 * Count to three runs for a moment, can be interrupted, can count one more
 * again, and says what it counted to; Finish runs at once and writes a note;
 * Look back can be stood on in any order and holds nothing up; Walk them
 * all walks Count and Finish in turn. Its one panel is a card with a
 * heading and a line of text that follows the run.

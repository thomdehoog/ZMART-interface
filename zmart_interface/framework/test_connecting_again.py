"""Connecting again while a scan is running hands the stage over cleanly.

A page that is reloaded connects again, and the bridge outlives the page.
Before these tests, the new connection reset the scan's record to "not
running" while the old scan carried on: it went on moving the stage, wrote
its pictures into the new run folder, and a second scan could be started
beside it, so two scans took turns moving the stage. The session it was
using was never closed.

Now connecting again first asks the running scan to stop between two fields
and waits for it, then closes the old session, and only then opens the new
one. A scan also stops on its own when the session it started with is no
longer the open one.

"""A picture whose place on the stage is unknown is refused, not put at the origin.

From the review of 10 October, finding 21: a plane without ``x_um`` or
``y_um`` was placed at the stage's zero (``or 0.0``), so a capture the
driver could not place appeared in the corner of the canvas as if it had
been taken there. The bridge's own picture copies already refused the same
plane; the position store now does too.

/**
 * The same promises, asked of both backends.
 *
 * The pretend one is asked on every change, because it needs nothing running.
 * The live one is asked when there is a bridge to ask — start one and point
 * this at it:
 *
 *     python -m zmart_interface.framework.bridge --port 8600
 *     BACKEND_BRIDGE=http://127.0.0.1:8600 npx vitest run zmart_interface/parts/microscope/backend-contract.test.js
 *
 * With the mock microscope behind that bridge it is a full round of the real path
 * — controller, driver contract — and the two answers are held
 * against the same list. That is the only arrangement in which the pretend
 * backend cannot quietly drift away from the instrument it stands for.

"""The microscope, in Python: the bridge's side of the seam where the instrument goes.

Its opposite number is the page's own ``microscope/`` folder, in JavaScript,
and the two mean the same thing on either side of the seam -- the code that
talks to the instrument, and nothing else. A browser cannot reach the
controller, so the page talks HTTP to the bridge; Python can, so this folder
holds what the bridge does with the controller's session: reading its answers
(``instrument.py``), filing a captured focus stack and shifting its height
into the stage's frame (``focus_run.py``), and the synthetic pixels used on
the LAS X simulator (``simulator_pixels.py``, guarded by
``simulator_guard.py``). What is done with the pixels once they are filed --
scoring a stack, finding objects -- is the analysis's, in ``../analysis/``.

"""One focus stack, once it has been captured: filed, scored and put in the stage's frame.

A focus map is measured one place at a time. The page drives the stage to a
place, has the microscope capture a z-stack around it, and then hands the
stack to the bridge, which calls :func:`measure_one_stack` here: the stack is
filed under the run, scored by ZMART-analysis, and the sharp height is
reported in the same frame the stage is driven in.

Why focusing is analysis, not a vendor procedure
------------------------------------------------

The instrument's own autofocus returns a height that cannot be argued with:
there is no curve to show, so the operator's choice of sharpness measure
reaches nothing, and the rule that rejects a peak too narrow to be tissue --
the defence against focusing on a speck of dust -- is never applied. So the
instrument is asked for what only it can give, pixels, and the choosing is
done where every other measurement on pixels is done.

``score`` is passed in rather than imported, so how the planes reach the
analysis, and how its environment is kept warm, is the caller's business.

Where the search begins
-----------------------

The stage is driven to the place the operator wants focused, and that place
is the **centre of the stack**. How far either side to look, and in what
steps, belongs to the focussing settings the instrument is set to.

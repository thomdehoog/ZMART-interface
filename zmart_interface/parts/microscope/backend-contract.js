/**
 * What the page is entitled to expect of a backend, whichever one it has.
 *
 * There are two of them — `mock.js`, which answers the page's verbs directly,
 * and `live.js`, which speaks HTTP to the bridge and through it to a real
 * driver — and the page is supposed not to be able to tell them apart. It
 * could. Every fault worth a fix in the operator page this week was one of
 * them behaving unlike the other: a pretend stage that never moved, so the
 * mark on the canvas was never seen to be drawn in the wrong place; a height
 * the bridge did not report, so the plot's marks read a field only the pretend
 * one filled in; a focus map that came back a column of zeros.
 *
 * None of those were visible from either side alone. What catches them is one
 * list of promises, run twice.
 *
 * The promises are about *behaviour*, not shape. A stage that answers with the
 * right three keys and never moves passes a shape check and fails an operator,
 * so what is asserted here is what the page actually leans on: drive it and it
 * is there; ask twice and it says the same thing; name an axis and only that
 * axis moves.
 *
 * Written as data rather than as tests so both runners can use them: the
 * offline suite runs them against `mock.js` on every change, and
 * `BACKEND_BRIDGE=http://127.0.0.1:8600 npx vitest run` runs the same list
 * against a bridge, which is the only way the two are ever held to each other.

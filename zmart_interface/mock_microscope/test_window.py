"""The mock instrument's window: choosing a job there is what the next capture is taken with.

The window is pywebview and cannot open here; its ``Api`` can, and that is
where the behaviour is: a job chosen in the window has to land in the same
settings file the mock's driver reads, or the operator page would import a
job the window was not showing.

"""The mock's kidney section ships with the package and needs no network.

From the review of 10 October, finding 11: the mock read its sample with
``skimage.data.kidney()``, which downloads 25 MB from gitlab.com the first
time. The microscope computer has no network, so the mock that is always
offered could not take a single picture there. The one plane it uses ships
beside the driver now.

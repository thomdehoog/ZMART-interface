"""The mock microscope's sample: one plane of a mouse kidney section, shipped with the package.

The section is scikit-image's ``kidney`` sample, imaged by Genevieve Buckley
at Monash Micro Imaging in 2018 on a Nikon C1 confocal microscope and
released under CC0 (free to use for any purpose). Only its middle plane is
used, three channels of 512 x 512 pixels, and that plane is kept here in
``kidney-plane.npz`` (about 1.3 MB) rather than downloaded: scikit-image
fetches the whole 25 MB stack from the internet the first time it is asked,
and the microscope computer has no network.

Two things draw on it: the mock microscope, which lays it across its whole
stage, and the synthetic pixels that stand in for the LAS X simulator's.

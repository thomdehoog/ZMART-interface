/**
 * Where the installed ZMART viewer keeps the drawing rules this page shares.
 *
 * This page and the viewer's own window draw with the same neuroglancer, and
 * they must draw the same way: the same primitives that steer it (making it,
 * keeping its layers in step, feeding and refreshing stores, its axes and
 * camera), the same little shader programs that turn a stored value into a
 * colour, and the same edits to neuroglancer that let a picture keep its
 * transparency and grow while it is on screen. The viewer owns all of these,
 * in its package's `drawing` folder, and this page takes them from there
 * rather than keeping copies of its own. Copies kept in line by hand drifted;
 * one owner cannot.
 *
 * So the viewer has to be installed in the Python that builds the page, and
 * it has to be the release `pyproject.toml` pins: another viewer builds
 * another page. `PYTHON=` names that Python when it is not the one on the path.
